Step 1 – Choose your shared password

Pick a phrase you will share only with your trusted guests, for example:

current --> "prawn-and-prejudice-2025"

*********NOTE**********
no, this isn't secure, this is literally just for fun, and to try out new code.

Longer phrases with spaces or punctuation are better.
Avoid something obvious like “shrimp123”.

You’ll never store this phrase on the site, only its hash.

Step 2 – Generate a SHA-256 hash of your password

You only have to do this once, whenever you change the password.

Quick way: run a tiny snippet in your browser

Open any page of your site in Chrome/Firefox.

Press F12 → go to the Console tab.

Paste this exactly:

(async () => {
  const password = "prawn-and-prejudice-2025"; // <-- put YOUR phrase here
  const enc = new TextEncoder().encode(password);
  const buf = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", enc);
  const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(buf));
  const hashHex = hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0")).join("");
  console.log(hashHex);
})();


Hit Enter.

The console will print a long hex string, like:

9f3c0b5b8f4f...etc

Copy that full hex string somewhere safe; we’ll paste it into scripts.js in a moment.

Anyone viewing your source will only see this hash, not the original phrase.
