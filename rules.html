        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, new faces and long-standing companions alike — welcome to the Shrimp Pantheon.</p>
        <p>
          For a good few years, we have gathered to share stories, games, laughter, and the occasional victory drink. As our circle grows and new guests join
          our table, we ask that all who enter learn and honor the traditions that have shaped our club.

        <ol class="rules-list">
          <li>
            <h3>Invitations &amp; New Guests</h3>
            <p>
              Attendance is by invitation only. New guests must be personally vouched for by an existing member of the Shrimp Pantheon, and must embody the
              courtesy and discretion expected of a gentleman or lady.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Respect for the Host &amp; the Home</h3>
            <p>
              Our gatherings are held in a private residence. All property — from furniture to game pieces — must be treated with care, appreciation, and the
              respect due to a generous host.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Contribution to the Evening</h3>
            <p>
              Each attendee is expected to contribute in some meaningful way. This may include bringing drinks, snacks, desserts, or other supplies. The aim is
              simple: to share the load so that no single person bears the evening’s full burden.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Privacy of Conversation</h3>
            <p>
              What is said, shared, or witnessed among the members remains within the walls of the club. No stories, disputes, or personal matters are to be
              taken outward or repeated elsewhere.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Conduct Befitting a Gentleman or Lady</h3>
            <p>
              All members shall treat each other with courtesy, dignity, and good humor. Disagreements are to be handled with grace; competition should remain
              friendly; and poor sportsmanship is unbecoming of our title.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Care for the Games Themselves</h3>
            <p>
              Our games are treasured and often dearly purchased. Cards should be handled cleanly and gently; pieces kept safe; and all components returned to
              their proper boxes when the night concludes.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Punctuality &amp; Participation</h3>
            <p>
              Arrive at a reasonable time, communicate delays, and do your best to stay engaged in the evening’s chosen games. A gentleman or lady does not
              vanish mid-session without notice.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Harassment &amp; Safety</h3>
            <p>
              Harassment, bullying, or overly aggressive behavior is incompatible with the values of the Pantheon. Any member engaging in such behavior may be
              disinvited from future gatherings.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Stewardship of Spirits</h3>
            <p>Drink responsibly. We enjoy our beverages, but we do so with awareness, respect, and an aim toward camaraderie — not chaos.</p>
